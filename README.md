# Project description
HiAlert is an AI-powered chatbox assistant designed to encourage accident reporting through dashboard cameras, making roads safer by increasing awareness and reducing negligence.

##  Problem Statement  

###  Challenges in Accident Reporting  
1Ô∏è. **Lack of Dashboard Camera Adoption** ‚Äì Many drivers don‚Äôt see the need for dashcams until they experience an accident.  
2Ô∏è. **Human Negligence & Reckless Driving** ‚Äì Speeding, distraction, and impaired vision contribute to preventable accidents.  
3Ô∏è. **Privacy Concerns & Legal Barriers** ‚Äì In some regions, people hesitate to upload footage due to legal risks or privacy laws.  
4Ô∏è. **Lack of Incentives for Reporting** ‚Äì Drivers don‚Äôt feel motivated to share footage if there‚Äôs no reward or clear benefit.  
5Ô∏è. **Difficult Access to Incident Data** ‚Äì Authorities and insurance companies struggle with delayed or missing accident evidence.  

üö¶ **Our Goal:**  
We aim to **increase accident reporting** and **promote dashcam usage** by creating an easy-to-use chatbox assistant, **HiAlert**, that:  
- Collects accident descriptions  
- Sends alerts based on **geolocation data**  
- Links relevant **dashcam footage**  

---

## Solution: HiAlert Chatbox  

###  How It Works  
- **User reports an accident** via a chatbot interface  
- **Chatbot requests key details**: accident type, description, location, dashcam footage  
- **Automated alert system** sends updates to relevant users  
- **Machine learning (optional)**: Identifies high-risk areas and patterns
